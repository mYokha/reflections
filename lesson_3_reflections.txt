When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I'm working on a project from another computer or when my frineds or
    coworkers who do not have access to my loclal repos work with me.
    The other way of using remote repos is for sharing my code.
    To back up code with a emote repository is usefui too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I pull data manually it doesn't happen unexpectedly.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of someones repo and exists on GitHub. Branch is like a step
    aside from some point on your project. Clone is a command used to copy. You 
    can clone an existing repo with a link from GitHub (from your or enyone 
    else's profile) or you can clone from one repo to another locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I'd use somethig like Dropbox or Google Docs. Tose are easier to understand
    but do not have suc a great functionality.
